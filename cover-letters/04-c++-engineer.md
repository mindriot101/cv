I would like to be considered for the position of 'Software Engineer C++'. 

For the last seven years, I have worked on developing and maintaining
software, in an academic setting, which has developed my analytical
skills and 

A key aspect of my current employment and Ph.D. is developing software, both to aid me in my data analysis, and to routinely process raw data for the project I work on. I am extremely experienced with Python and C++, along with common data processing and machine learning libraries such as numpy, matplotlib and scikit-learn. I am confident in handling large quantities of data which do not fit in memory, and applying statistical methods and machine learning techniques. My work involves pre-processing and signal processing techniques, along with normalisation techniques.

My work also requires me to have a high level of communication skills, and to convey methods and outcomes to other members of my team. My work has lead to me leading a distributed team in multiple time zones, coordinating the flow of knowledge back and forth. I routinely present my work at weekly teleconferences, and biannual face to face meetings.

Outside of work, I enjoy contributing to open source software, and maintaining my own projects. I have attended PyCon UK multiple times, including a presentation on my work in astronomy, and I participate in programming meetups. I am also interested in music, playing several instruments. Through musical activities and commitment to open source software, I have acquired a high level of self-motivation, giving me the tenacity to remain committed and focused on a project until a successful outcome is achieved.
